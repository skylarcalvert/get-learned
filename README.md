# get-learned

## Words of encouragement
It can be a life long journey learning to code, I still learn new things weekly while at work. You will get better by spending time with the material, trying to do neat things that you can show off to others, or that may be helpful in pre-calc homework. The more you learn now the cooler things you can do with it in the future.


Don't be afraid to leverage eachother over break, spend time building something fun together through text/email/phone calls, you can both improve and have fun in the downtime of holiday break.
If you need to contact me for any questions or for some help, Mr. Singer has my email.
Merry Christmas, find ways to program over break, and we'll see you next year!

## What would you like to do?
### Practice Python on chromebook (Not downloaded locally)
- [Online-Python](https://www.online-python.com/)
  - From here, you can easily upload old files, or write new files and save for later

  - Once you're done with the file and want to save for later, download the file to your computer and upload to Google Drive

### Get access to online material
- An easy place to start is here [PY4e](https://www.py4e.com/lessons)
  - This gentleman from Michigan has videos explaining concepts as well as files that have plenty of details outlining concepts, but most importantly **exercises** that can go with the material

### Build fun starter programs
1. The Number Guessing Game
  - Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100
  - Prompt a user to guess what the number is
  - When a user guesses wrong, tell them if the correct number is higher or lower and prompt them to guess again
  - When the user guesses correctly, tell the user and tell them how many times they guessed
  - End the program
  - Once complete, can you think of ways to improve the program? Error handling(what if user enters something not a number?), or limits the number attempts they have
2. Rock, Paper, Scissors program
  - Write a program that a user can play rock paper scissors against
  - The program randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors, and prompts the user to make a selection
  - The program lets the user know what the computer selected and if they won, lost, or tied
  - Extra Credit: Error handling, Let the user pick how many rounds to play and keep track, trick your friends and write the game to always beat the user
